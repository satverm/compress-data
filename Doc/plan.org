#A plan for compressing data
# Plan:
 1. Open any file containing the data.
 2. Find the repeating patterns in the data and make groups of data.
 3. Do an analysis of whether to have a repeated large number of smaller groups or small number of larger patteen groups.
 4. Make a dictionary for these groups with just one item of each group.
 5. Them make a list of all items with just their codes. This list will be used to get back the file using the dictionary which stores actual data.
 6. First we will use the program for a small txt file and then use the same concept for any file.
